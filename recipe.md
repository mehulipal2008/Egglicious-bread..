Procedure: -

	Heat some oil in a pan and fry the chopped veggies together. Then keep them aside in a bowl.
	Cut the bread into small squares (you can keep the sides too). Fry them in the pan. 
	Now take the fried veggies and bread in the pan and put an egg over them while the pan is hot.
	Then, scramble the egg very well and also check that some part of the egg is also mixed with the veggies. 
Now, serve it hot with any topping as your liking (like chilli flakes or grated cheese or even ketchup).
ENJOY!
